# Decentralized Applications For Selling Limited Time Artwork
Selling artwork using a Decentralized Application (DApp).

This repository houses the Solidity, JavaScript, and HTML code for a Decentralized Application (DApp) that facilitates the sale of limited-time artwork on the Ethereum blockchain. The Truffle Suite served as the development environment for creating and testing the smart contract (written in Solidity). Using Ganache, the contract was subsequently deployed to the Ethereum Testnets. The data displayed on the website's user interface is supported by the smart contract in the backend, while the front end relies on HTML and JavaScript files.

This DApp was developed by Keyan Ahmadi and Athmha Krishnasamy and was presented as our final project for the graduate course APS1050 (Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrencies) at the University of Toronto. The Executive Summary for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/K2Ahmadi/Decentralized-Applications-For-Selling-Limited-Time-Artwork/blob/main/Project-Summary/Project%20Summary.pdf). A step-by-step instruction manual on how to navigate through our DApp Marketplace, along with all the necessary software prerequisites, can be found [here](https://github.com/K2Ahmadi/Decentralized-Applications-For-Selling-Limited-Time-Artwork/blob/main/Setup-Instructions/Setup%20Instructions.pdf).
